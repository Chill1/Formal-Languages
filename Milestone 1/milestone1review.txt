Neat DFA diagram in a .pdf
- meh
State-transition table
- ok
Descriptions of each state
- ok
5 test cases accepted by the DFA
- ok
5 test cases rejected by the DFA 
- ok

Analysis
- Not good quality of DFA diagram
- Good state descriptions
- Good and efficient construction of the DFA

Completeness 
- Test cases are difficult and interesting
- Includes both correct and incorrect statements
- Includes both correct and incorrect asignments
- Includes both correct and incorrect identifiers

Correctness
- DFA diagram is incorrect:
  > some states do not consider the possibility of receiving all possible
    symbols in the alphabet
- Tables are correct
- Test cases are correct
