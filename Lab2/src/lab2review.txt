Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the correct format.


Style:

- Incorrect position of some opening braces { . Opening braces should appear on
  the same line as the preceding statement (i.e. function opening, if, for,
  while, etc.).

- Good block comments

- Classes do not have a description. Each class declaration must have a comment
  block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose of the
  class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.


CSV files:

- State-transition table looks good.

- Usually the description of states includes more than just identifying if they
  are accepting or non accepting states. The description describes what does it
  mean to be in that state.
